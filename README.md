# Voxel engine

This is a voxel project made with Godot Engine. I am currently using Godot 3.2 alpha 1 while developping this project. You also need to have the Godot mono version to be able to compile the C# solution.

## Why am I doing project?

First of all, I am not doing this for anyone except me and those who interested in this project. This is not a game, there is no real vision for this project except making a beautiful world by code. Voxel engines are a good challenge for anyone that wants to push their limits. I learned a lot by working on this project, and I plan to continue to do so.  

## Why are you calling this an engine?

I am calling this an engine because I the goal of this project is to abstract everything that relates to voxel managment and rendering from the gameplay elements. I'm basicaly handling everything in another thread form the main game thread. 

## How can I test it?

The full source code can be run and compiled by following those steps:

1. Clone the source `git clone [https://github.com/antopilo/VoxelEngine.git](https://github.com/antopilo/VoxelEngine.git)`
2. Download Godot 3.2 alpha mono from : [https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2/alpha1/mono/](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2/alpha1/mono/)
3. Import the project in godot by selecting `Import` then select the `project.godot`

    file.

4. Press play! 

You can also open the solution using visual studio but you won't be able to run it from there, you need to run it using Godot engine. You can still build the solution to see if there are any errors during compilation.
